On October 1st 2020 the main instance of invidious will stop functioning. I have switched to another instance but if Google decides to make changes to Youtube and the API isn't updated the site will probably stop working (atleast where the changes are made).

# Invuedious
 A frontend for invidious that uses the invidious APIs.

## In progress
- Sort videos
- Sort comments

## Known issues
- Sometimes the invidious api doesn't work correctly and the requests fail (there's a retry button in case it happens)
